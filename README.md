StripperParser
==============

Validator for Stripper:Source map config files.
Provides errors and warnings, syntax highlighting.

Planned: block-content analysis; property/value content checks for the various kinds of blocks, etc.
Ideally, I'd like StripperParser to be able to warn you about adding stuff without a classname, failing to set important values depending on contexts, warn about fishy event script code, etc.
